# odin-recipes
Here we have a project that will show off some of my favorite recipes aswell as a handfull of basic html skills all documented with git.
Starting off I began with creating a github repo and cloned it on my local computer.
From the terminal i create files with the touch command and directories with mkdir command documenting with git as I go.
In the index.html file I begin with the most basic boilerplate using titles and headers to make it readable for most people.
In the second html file I do the same and eventually there are 3 recipe pages demonstrating my understanding of the following.
Relative links wich direct to html files on the local server, <strong><strong> which boldend text and makes it more readable 
for the disabled, orderd lists, unorderd lists and links to image files.
Finishing up the project I have also added images to the index.html page links back to index.html on the recipe pages and increased
the size of the link text with h1-h5
